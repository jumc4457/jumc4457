        <h1>Fender Jaguar</h1>
        <p>
            The Fender Jaguar is an electric guitar by Fender Musical Instruments characterized by an offset-waist body, a relatively unusual switching system with two separate circuits for lead and rhythm, and a short-scale 24" neck. Owing some roots to the Jazzmaster, it was introduced in 1962 as Fender's feature-laden top-of-the-line model, designed to lure players from Gibson. During its initial 13-year production run, the Jaguar did not sell as well as the less expensive Stratocaster and Telecaster, and achieved its most noticeable popularity in the surf music scene. After the Jaguar was taken out of production in 1975, vintage Jaguars became popular first with American punk rock players, and then more so during the alternative rock, shoegazing and indie rock movements of the 1980s and 1990s. Fender began making a version in Japan in the mid-1980s, and then introduced a USA-made reissue in 1999. Since then, Fender has made a variety of Jaguars in America, Mexico, Indonesia and China under both the Fender and Squier labels. Original vintage Jaguars sell for many times their original price.

        <h3>Initial Production, 1962-75</h3>
        <p>Both the Fender company[1] and vintage guitar authorities[2][3][4] date the introduction of the Jaguar to 1962. One writer states that the model was introduced in December 1960,[5] but a 1962 ad featuring a Jaguar automobile in the background referred to the "new" Fender Jaguar.[1] 1960s advertising for the Jaguar often had beach themes, underscoring the guitar's appeal to surf musicians. Photographs for the campaign, done by Bob Perine, included photographs of bikini-clad girls on sandy beaches holding Jaguars—many of these featured Perine's daughter and her friends. The guitar was not, however, heavily publicized by surf players themselves, although The Beach Boys' Carl Wilson is featured in one early publicity photo.[2] The Jaguar never enjoyed the popularity of its Stratocaster and Telecaster siblings. After several upgrades—which included custom finishes, a bound neck, pearloid block inlays, maple fingerboard with black binding, and block inlays—the Jaguar was discontinued in December 1975[5] after a thirteen-year production run.

        <h3>Resurgence</h3>
        <p>
            Punk and early new wave guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of the band Television (who can be seen playing a Jaguar on a 2003 album cover)[1] adopted the Jaguar for both contrarian and economic reasons; its lack of mainstream use made it both a style statement and less expensive than guitars of comparable quality.[6] In the 1990s the popularity of the Jaguar and Jazzmaster exploded after they were used by guitarists such as Scott Hill, John Squire,[7] Kurt Cobain (for whom a signature model was introduced),[8] Kevin Shields, Black Francis, J Mascis, Brian Molko, Rowland S. Howard,[9] Thurston Moore, John Frusciante, Will Sergeant[10] and Johnny Marr (who has a signature model).[11] Despite this, Jaguars still fetch considerably less than Telecasters and Stratocasters of similar vintage.[2] One of the reasons why the Jaguar was used by indie rock artists is the sonic possibilities offered by the bridge construction. The bridge and vibrato unit of the Jaguar and the Jazzmaster help produce sympathetic resonance since there is a considerable length of string between the bridge and the tailpiece. Additionally, by strumming the strings behind the bridge, a characteristic chiming sound can be created,[2] an effect which has been exploited by artists like Sonic Youth. Given the relative rarity of Jaguar players, perhaps the only example of a band that used two guitarists on Jaguars simultaneously in performance on certain of their numbers was the 2003-2004 and post-2012 lineups of The Mavericks, featuring Raul Malo and Eddie Perez.

        <h2 id="Reissue">Reissue</h2>
        <p>Fender reissued the 1962 version of the Jaguar in 1999 as part of its American Vintage Reissue (AVRI) Series (lower cost Japanese-made versions were available between 1984 and 2015, originally made of basswood and then alder like their American counterparts). Several other variations have been released within the last decade, including several humbucker versions and a Jaguar bass guitar in 2006. Fender Japan produced Jaguars for its own domestic market with numerous special editions including an accurate version of Kurt Cobain's modified model until Fender chose to end the licensing agreement in place since the early 1980s in favor of taking over Japanese production themselves in 2015. There are notable differences between the typical Japanese models and their American counterparts. One of the more notable examples would be the electronics: Japanese production models typically used cheaper wiring, miniature pots throughout the guitar (as opposed to only in the rhythm circuit as would be found on original and AVRI examples), lower-quality pickups, and shielding paint as opposed to brass shielding plates installed in the cavities (Japanese guitars made before 96/97 also have brass shielding) seen on typical American Jaguars. Original and AVRI variants have nitrocellulose lacquer finishes, while Japanese versions would typically be finished in polyester, though there are rare Japanese examples with nitrocellulose finishes as well. US-produced AVRI Jaguars often did not sport matching headstocks, unlike their vintage counterparts, however, many Japanese models do, and also offer some custom colors not found as easily on American models.[citation needed] In the late 2000s, Fender began to offer limited editions of the AVRI models from a few of their more-popular retailers, with these specific variants being referred to as the Thin Skin series. A collaboration between several notable American guitar retailers (Such as Dave's Guitar Shop in Wisconsin and Wildwood Guitars in Colorado) culminated in the release of otherwise typical AVRI Jaguars as well as Jazzmasters, Telecasters, and Stratocasters, but in more sought-after Classic finishes that Fender otherwise had little interest in releasing themselves. These were almost identical to the production AVRI models, with the exception of their finish options and the inclusion of matching headstocks, a 9.5" fretboard radius instead of the vintage-accurate 7.25", and jumbo fretwire. The Thin Skin models used 100% nitrocellulose finishes, a departure from the production models, which used polyurethane undercoats/sealers. These Thin Skin models also featured thinner color and clear coats. These models were available in a number of Custom Colors, and, unlike the standard production '62 Jaguars, these did feature matching headstocks. In 2012, Fender replaced the entire AVRI line with the American Vintage (AV) Series. The AV Series included more vintage-accurate appointments, such as more accurate decals, thinner cases (as would be found with original 1950s/60s models), a new 'flash' finishing process, updated neck profiles, pickups, tuners, and vintage-reproduction paperwork and manuals. The replacement for the 1962 Jaguar was the 1965 Jaguar. The 1965 Jaguar features a bound rosewood fingerboard with larger pearloid dot inlays, a slightly larger C profile, new, more vintage-accurate pickups, a thinner finish, no amber tint in the clear coat on the neck, and ships with a black tolex case with a red plush interior. Originally offered in Candy Apple Red and Three-Color Sunburst, the Candy Apple Red has since been discontinued. As with the AVRI model, the headstock on the AV '65 in Candy Apple Red did not feature a matching headstock. Fender did offer a limited production run of the '65 Jaguar in Ice Blue Metallic, which did feature a matching headstock. Fender's Custom Shop also produces various Jaguar models, many of which are reissues/relics. Some of the Custom Shop offerings feature modern appointments (such as radius, pickups, hardware, and finishes). Although Fender has many signature Stratocasters and Telecasters designed in conjunction with famous players and the first signature Jazzmasters were introduced in 2007, Kurt Cobain's signature Jaguar was introduced in 2011 (20th anniversary of the release of Nirvana's Nevermind album). In the past, a Kurt Cobain replica Jaguar was made for the Japanese domestic market. The Fender Jag-Stang, a Mustang/Jaguar hybrid, was built for Kurt Cobain based on his design.[citation needed]
           In May 2008 Fender introduced the Classic Player Series Jaguar and Jaguar HH with dual Enforcer humbuckers, which are made in Mexico and sold for under $1000. Fender have made numerous changes to the classic design, however, replacing the bridge with a Tune-o-matic type, giving it a 9.5" fretboard radius, moving the vibrato unit plate closer to the bridge and installing high output pickups. This Classic Player guitar is also available as a "1966" limited-edition version with a bound neck featuring rectangular block inlays and CBS-style decals as of 2009.[citation needed]
           In September 2010 the Black Top Jaguar HH was introduced as part of the Mexico-made Black Top series. Features include a solid alder body with gloss polyester finish, chrome hardware, dual Hot Vintage AlNiCo humbucking pickups with chrome metal covers and black skirted amp knobs. Other refinements include a maple neck with a 9.5"-radius rosewood fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, 24"-scale length, a stop tailpiece and a three-way toggle switch.

        <h2 id="Features">Features</h2>
        <p>The Jaguar was built from ideas first incorporated in the Jazzmaster, with a similar "offset waist" body and vibrato unit. Unlike the Jazzmaster, the Jaguar was fitted with a shorter 24-inch scale, 22-fret neck and featured smaller single-coil pickups with notched side plates that improved RF shielding, making the Jaguar less prone to interference than the more popular Stratocaster and Telecaster.
           The Jaguar and the Jazzmaster also shared a dual-circuit setup, one circuit for lead and another for rhythm, each with separate controls, allowing for two preset tone and volume settings between which the guitarist could rapidly switch. The Jaguar, however, had a more complex lead circuit consisting of three switches and two dials on the lower bout:[12] the first two switches were on/off switches for the neck and bridge pickups, respectively, while the third switch engaged a capacitor that served as a high-pass filter (sometimes referred to as a "strangle" switch). The rhythm circuit, set into operation when the upper bout switch is flicked upwards, had individual volume and tone rollers but no option to choose between pickups. This rhythm circuit has a bassier, neck-pickup only range.
           Another new feature was a spring-loaded rubber string mute, which was flipped upwards from under the strings by a lever. The mute was designed for guitarists who had to palm mute for extended periods, which was difficult or impossible on the Jaguar's floating bridge without knocking the bridge out of position. This feature proved unpopular and became known as a "tone killer"; the cover and its foam were usually quickly removed.[2]
           The bridge on many versions of the Jaguar has become known for several design shortcomings and consequent problems. The "threaded" bridge saddles allow the strings to slip out of alignment if they are plucked or strummed hard, motivating some players to fit replacement saddles that have deeper slots or grooves to hold the strings, or to replace the bridge completely. The Fender Mustang style bridge is a popular choice of replacement. Another issue sometimes encountered is a tendency for the bridge's support posts to slip down into the holes that house them. Some people have use strategies inconsistent with the original intended physics to stop the bridge from rocking as it was designed to do,[13] including wrapping tape around the bridge posts.[14][15] Like the Jazzmaster and Bass VI, the Jaguar has an unusual floating vibrato mechanism that was a complete departure from the "synchronized vibrato" system found on the Stratocaster. Leo Fender believed that this new design was superior to previous designs since the bridge actually moved backwards and forwards along with the strings during vibrato use, thereby maintaining proper intonation even under duress, and preventing strings from binding. This floating bridge concept was also later used on the Fender Mustang. The floating vibrato mechanism also features a built-in lock, which helped the player preserve the guitar's tuning in the event of a string breakage and easing removal of the vibrato arm

        <h4>Fender 50th Anniversary Jaguar</h4>
        <p>To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Jaguar in 2012, Fender released a USA-made model that featured a C-shaped maple neck with lacquer finish and vintage-style truss rod, bound 9.5"-radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets and pearloid block inlays, a modified one-degree neck-angle-pocket cut to improve pitch, a re-positioned tremolo plate to increase bridge break angle to prevent string slippage and increased sustain, a custom neckplate and specially designed hotter wound single-coil neck and bridge pickups for fatter tone and more output. The 50th Anniversary Jaguar was available in three Custom Colors: Burgundy Mist Metallic, Candy Apple Red, and Lake Placid Blue. The first 100 of each color were hand-numbered.

        <h4>Fender Blacktop</h4>
        <p>A Jaguar with high-output humbuckers, alder body, maple neck with rosewood fretboard, 9,5" radius, T.O.M./STP style bridge, volume and tone pots and a three-way Gibson style pickup switch.
        </p>
        <h4>Fender Blacktop Jaguar FSR with Neck Binding</h4>
        <p>Similar to the regular Blacktop Jaguar with high-output humbuckers, alder body, maple neck with rosewood fretboard, 9,5" radius, T.O.M./STP style bridge, volume and tone pots and a three-way Gibson style pickup switch. This model was manufactured for Guitar Center as a Fender Special Run and came in Blizzard Pearl or Metallic Surf Green. The Blizzard Pearl model featured white neck binding, while the Metallic Surf Green featured mint colored neck binding. The other difference between this and the regular Blacktop models was the presence of flathead screw adjustable Tune-o-matic posts and regular Jaguar knobs.
        </p>
        <h4>Fender Jaguar Special HH</h4>
        <p>Has the same body shape as the standard Jaguar, but is equipped with two low-output Fender designed Dragster humbucking pickups, a fixed Adjust-o-matic bridge (similar to a Gibson Tune-o-matic), a 24" scale length, and chrome knobs. It is made in Japan.
